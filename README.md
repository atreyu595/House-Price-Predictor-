# House-Price-Predictor-

The Following repository contains source code belonging to personal project of mine that extends upon the conventional House Price prediction using Linear Regression.

The following project aims at developing a crucial understanding of Full-stack Data Science development. The project consists of:
- Requirements Analysis: Understand the goal, context and key metrics to observe.
- Data Collection: The data was sourced from a reliable website such as Kaggle -> Dataset: USA Housing: https://www.kaggle.com/vedavyasv/usa-housing.
- Exploratory Analysis: Understand key descriptive and sample statistics, determine any null values, generate plots which assess the distributions and normality of the dataset.
- Data Wrangling/Manipulation: Separate and convert data types, isolate explanatory and predictor variables.
- Data Pre-processing: Split data into training and testing sets
- Model Development: Develop regression analysis
- Model Evaluation: Analyse goodness-of-fit, RMSE and correlations.
- Deployment: Deploy model into website application
